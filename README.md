# LibMultiSpacc

LibMultiSpacc is a library aiming to provide cross-platform abstractions for a number of less-cross-platform libraries.

The list of backend libraries supported follows:

- SDL 1.2 (WIP)
- SDL 2.0 (planned)

Example programs (and makefiles) will come soon.

### Licensing

I have yet to choose a license for this. I would like for the library to be usable by as many people as possible (and, for that, the Unlicense o zlib license would be the best), but I have yet to understand legal compatibility with all the different libraries mine is made to work on top of.
