# LibMultiSpacc

LibMultiSpacc is a library aiming to provide cross-platform abstractions for a number of less-cross-platform libraries.

The idea is simple: to build an universal abstraction layer on top of other existing libraries, that developers can use in their code instead of the platform-specific calls, to make it possible for an application to get build-time support for a major number of previously incompatible platforms.

The list of supported (or planned) backend libraries follows:

- SDL 1.2 (WIP)
- SDL 2.0 (WIP)

Example programs (and makefiles) will come soon.

### Licensing

I have yet to choose a license for this. I would like for the library to be usable by as many people as possible (and, for that, the Unlicense o zlib license would be the best), and possibly to also demand that credit is given to me (citing my library name), but I have yet to understand legal compatibility with all the different libraries mine is made to work on top of.
